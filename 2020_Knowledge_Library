This document provides a library of tips, functions, code snippets, and concepts that may be useful to others in the 2020 Boot Camp. 

Each Entry in the library should contain 4 main components: 1.  A descriptive title, 2. a general classifiction (R code, stat method, data manipulation method, etc.), 
3. a brief description, and 4. an example. 


TITLE: Basics of Using GitHub
Class: data manipulation and storage
Description: Github provides a central repository for storing data. It also offers a structured appoach to collaboratively work on a document. One person "owns" the 
document in a repository and provides access to others. Others can "committ" changes to the document. Once a "committ" of changes are made, that person makes opens a
"pull request". With the "pull request", the owner reviews the changes and merges changes with the original document. 
Example: We can use the making additions to this document within Github as an example of how to make "committs" and "pull requests". Say you want to add one more your 
own entry in the knowledge library. You would: i. open the 2020_Knowledge_Library document, ii. create a "branch", iii. make your additions to the document, iv. committ 
the changes, and then v. submit a pull request.   

AMAZING!
cool!
